Sesame is a curated collection of playful, polished UI components and microinteractions you can drop into your React projects.

Built with modern web tooling, these pieces are designed to be approachable, composable, and a little unexpected. Use them as-is, remix them, or treat them as inspiration for your own UI experiments.

Core technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Motion (Framer Motion)

## Why Sesame?

The web often favors safe, predictable UI patterns — which is great for usability, but it can make interfaces feel samey. Sesame exists to nudge design in a different direction: playful, tactile, and occasionally delightfully strange. Each component focuses on a small, well-scoped interaction that adds personality without sacrificing accessibility or maintainability.

## How to use

Start by visiting the <Link href="/docs/installation">Installation</Link> guide to add Sesame to your project. Each component includes usage notes, props/type definitions, and small examples to help you get started quickly.

## Open source and contributions

Sesame is open source and free for personal and commercial use. Contributions, bug reports, and new ideas are very welcome — see the contribution guide for details on submitting PRs and issues.

## Design Inspo / Shoutouts

This collection was assembled from techniques and visual ideas spotted across the web. Big thanks and shoutouts to the designers and sites that inspired specific components and interactions — their work helped shape the playful spirit of Sesame.

Happy building — and enjoy adding a little sesame to your UI.
