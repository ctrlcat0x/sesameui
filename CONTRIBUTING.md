## Development

### Fork this repo

You can fork this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of this page.

### Clone on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sesame.git
```

### Navigate to project directory

```bash
cd sesame
```

### Create a new Branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the registry index and the source files. This is needed to access the components in the documentation.

```bash
npm run build:registry
```

Then, you're ready for development!

The project uses Contentful as a CMS, from where we fetch some component data. Namely: thumbnail and video demo URLs. These URLs are used as sources in the landing page, and for the og:image meta on each component page.

As of now, the environment variables aren't available publicly, therefore you will not see the images in the landing page. We will create a workaround for this soon.

## Components

Before you add a component, please make sure to review and understand the [Acceptance Criteria](./ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md).

If you think your component is a good fit, read on.

### 1. Component source

1. Navigate to the `src/content/docs/components` directory. This directory divides the components into different categories, such as `text`, `background`, `blocks`, etc. This is somewhat an arbitrary decision, but it helps us organize the components better. Choose one category, or create a new one if you think it's appropriate.
2. Create the component inside the chosen folder. Make sure to use the correct [tech stack](./ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md#stack). Comments are appreciated, but not required.
3. If you're using new dependencies, feel free to install them in the `package.json` file.
4. If you're using new hooks, please add them to the `src/hooks` directory.
5. If you're using new utilities, please add them to the `src/utils` directory, unless you want them in the same file as the component.
6. When importing hooks and utilities, always use the `@/hooks` and `@/utils` path aliases (e.g. `import { useHook } from "@/hooks/use-hook"`). This is crucial because the registry build script looks for these specific import paths in the source code to determine which files and dependencies to include in the generated registry. Without the correct import paths, the CLI installation won't work properly.
7. Please add yourself (or others if there are multiple ones) as the author in all files as a comment, in the following format: `// author: author_1 <https://x.com/author_1>, author_2 <https://x.com/author_2?`. Please refer to [this example](./src/sesame/components/blocks/stacking-cards.tsx) for reference.

Some things cannot be fetched from the source file, such as:

- CSS variables, if applicable.
- The component's dev dependencies (eg. types for matter-js), if applicable.
- The component's additional dependencies, which aren't listed in the source file of the component, but are required for the component to work properly.

Therefore, you need to add these config in a .json file with the same name as the component, next to the component .tsx file. The schema for this json is defined the [registry schema file](./src/sesame/schema.ts). Please, refer to [this example](./src/sesame/components/blocks/circling-elements.json) (additional css config) and [this example](./src/sesame/components/text/gravity.json) (additional dependencies) for reference.

### 2. Component demo(s)

1. Navigate to the `src/sesame/examples` directory.
2. In the same category folder as the component source, create a new file for the component demo. The file name should be the component name in kebab-case, ideally followed by `-demo`. If applicable, you can create multiple demos and examples, showing different use cases or variations of the component.

### 3. Generate source

1. Run `npm run build:registry`. This will run a script which will generate the source files for the component documentation, as well as the registry index file. You don't need to worry about what's inside (hopefully), but this is definitely needed, otherwise you can't reference the component in the documentation, you won't be able to see the source code, and the CLI installation won't work.

### 4. Component documentation

1. Navigate to the `src/content/docs/components` directory.
2. In the same category folder as the component source, create a new `.mdx` file for the documentation.
3. In the component header, add a title, description.
4. Also add yourself as the author (and others, if there are multiple ones) in the following format, ideally with a link to your website or other profile: `author: author_1 <https://x.com/author_1>, author_2 <https://x.com/author_2?`.

An example of a component header:

```mdx
---
title: Letter Swap Hover
description: A text component that swaps the letters vertically on hover.
component: true
author: johndoe <https://example.com>
---
```

5. The first node after the header should be a `ComponentPreview` component, which will render the main demo of the component.
6. Then, a header called `Installation`. There should be a `Tabs` component there, with two tabs: `CLI` and `Manual`. The `CLI` tab should contain the command to install the component with `npx shadcn@latest add "https://fancycomponents.dev/r/component-name.json"`. The `Manual` tab should contain the source code of the component referenced in a `ComponentSource` component.
7. If the component uses hooks, or need to add other dependencies, make sure to include them in that section, in a `ComponentSource` component.
8. Add an `Usage` and/or `Understanding the component` section, if applicable.
9. Add an `Examples` section, if applicable.
10. Add a `Notes` section, if applicable.
11. Add a `Props` section. Please use the `Table` components for this.
12. Add an `Credits` section, if applicable. Make sure to also include the credits under each demo, if applicable.

Please, have a look at an [existing component](./src/content/docs/components/blocks/circling-elements.mdx) for reference.

### 5. Update the navbar

In the `src/config/docs.ts` file, add a new item to the `docsConfig` array, at the correct category. Please make sure to add the `href`, and `New` as the `label`.

When you're done and ready to submit your PR, please create a quick recording of your work, and upload it to the PR description. It will help us to speed up the review process. Check out [this PR](https://github.com/danielpetho/sesame/pull/2) for reference.

That's it, you're done! If you feel stuck anywhere, please don't hesitate to ask for help.

## Maintainers & publishing

If you're a maintainer and want to publish Sesame to npm and host demo assets on a CDN, follow these steps:

1. Update the package.json `name` to the desired npm package name (e.g. `@ctrlcat0x/sesame` or `sesame`) and update `version` accordingly.
2. Create a GitHub repository at `https://github.com/ctrlcat0x/sesame` and push your changes.
3. Create a maintainer account on npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) and add the `ctrlcat0x` user as a maintainer.
4. Build and test locally: `npm run build`.
5. Authenticate with npm: `npm login` then publish: `npm publish --access public` (for scoped packages use `--access public`).
6. For thumbnails/demos, a CDN is recommended. Set up a provider (Bunny, Cloudflare, S3 + CloudFront, or similar).

- Upload demo images and videos to the CDN and set `BUNNY_CDN_URL` or similar env var used in the codebase.
- Ensure fallback to local `public/` is implemented for development.

If you want me to add automated GitHub Actions for publishing or CDN upload, I can add a starter workflow.
